# Medical_Coder_Assistant
Developing an AI medical coder assistant is my project, aiming to reduce workload in healthcare.  
I'm learning SLMs now, progressing to LLMs for advanced medical documentation.  
My ambition is to be an AI specialist, inspired by Assoc. Prof. Bukhoree Sahoh's expertise.  
I welcome code sharing and collaboration for continuous improvement.
